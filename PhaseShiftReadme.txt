Phase Shift v0.4.0

Phase Shift is a modification of Outpost 2 that alters the game flow in a number of ways.  Check Phase Shift Changes.txt for details.
It relies on OP2ext, which is included in the community build of the game, available at https://www.outpost2.net

This ZIP file is designed to be extracted directly into the installation folder for Outpost 2.  Then, run Outpost2.exe /loadmod PhaseShift to tell the game to use these modified game files.

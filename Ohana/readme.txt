Ohana v0.5

This is a 2 player multiplayer map for Outpost 2: Divided Destiny.  To use, copy these files to your Outpost 2 installation folder:
	ohana.map : The tile data, etc. for the map.
	mf2_oha.dll : A 2 player multiplayer Space Race mission that supports PhaseShift.  Appears as "Ohana - Phase Shift" in the map selection menu.
	mf2_ohv.dll : The same as the above, but without the PhaseShift specific code.

Feel free to utilize the map for other projects.

Enjoy,
Crow!

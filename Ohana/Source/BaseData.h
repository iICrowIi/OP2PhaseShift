// Note: We are using this file to define starting resource 
//		 and base/player starting locations. Building locations
//		 are given relative to some center. The idea is to define
//		 a base layout without specifying the base. This allows
//		 the same layout to be used to create multiple bases.
// Note: See OP2Helper.h for the definitions of the structures used
//		 here. As a general reminder, location (x and y coordinates)
//		 are given before other values and are typically the first two
//		 values in each structure.
// Note: The structure of this file was completely arbitrary
//		 and there is no requirement to do things the way they
//		 are done here. This is however a recommended method
//		 for designing resource and base layouts.

#define numof(array) (sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0]))
// Used to make specifying the size of the array and the array easier
#define autosize(array) numof(array), array



// Note: We are arbitrarily defining 5 components for each base here.
//		 Each component type is defined using relative coordinates to
//		 some center point (to be specified later). Essentially what we
//		 are doing is defining a base layout (for each of the 5 base 
//		 components seperately). This allows base components to be mixed
//		 and matched when specifying an overall base layout. In other
//		 words, you can specify a set a buildings once and two sets of
//		 vehicles to create two base layouts that share the same
//		 buildings (in the same relative positions) but have different
//		 starting units.
// Note: In this simple example, we are defining 4 seperate bases and not
//		 reusing any components of the base layouts. Furthur, to keep
//		 things simple, and fair for multiplayer, the base components are
//		 just reflections about the x and y axis. Also, we have (arbirarily)
//		 chosen the Command Center to be at the center of the base
//		 (relative coordinates (0,0)), which is of course the dead center
//		 of the bases we are defining.




// Note: Here we are defining the map resources. This includes
//		 all mining beacons, both common ore and rare ore, 
//		 fumaroles and magma vents.
// Note: For fumaroles and magma vents, not all fields make sense
//		 and should be set to -1.
// Note: For mining beacons, the last three fields are "rare",
//		 "bar", and "variant". Set rare = 0 to make the mine a common
//		 ore mine and rare = 1 to make the mine a rare ore mine.
//		 Set bar = 0 for a 3 bar mine, bar = 1 for a 2 bar mine,
//		 and bar = 2 for a 1 bar mine.
//		 The variant field controls which type of 1 bar, 2 bar, 
//		 or 3 bar mine is created. See Mines.txt from Sheets.vol 
//		 for details. Set variant = -1 to randomly select which 
//		 variant is created.
// Note: Here we are defining four sets of beacon layouts to be
//		 attached to each base layout. This allows the beacons to
//		 be automatically moved with the base if the base coordinates
//		 are changed. This is useful for specifying starting ore
//		 that each player should have, and helps maintain fairness.
// Note: One big list containing all the resources is not really
//		 the best idea. Such a list can be used to place beacons
//		 around the map that aren't associated with any starting
//		 location. However, specifying starting ore can lead to
//		 problems this way. If the ore needs to be randomized, you'll
//		 want to avoid having all the ore appear in one players base.
//		 If randomizing a list of seperate types of resources, you'll
//		 want to avoid all resources of the same type being picked.
//		 To avoid this, one of the best setups is to use seperate
//		 lists for the resources around each person's base, and
//		 to use seperate lists for each type of resource.

// Note: Here we define what buildings we want and their relative positions.

//		 a building enum after it has been created, or you can call
//		 CreateUnit directly rather than specifying the factory in one
//		 of the structures below. Either way gets you a unit class which
//		 may then be used to call Unit.SetFactoryCargo.
// Note: Due to lack of a field for specifying the weapon, you also may not
//		 be able to create Guard Posts here. You can either create Guard
//		 Posts manually by calling CreateUnit, or you can stuff in the

// Note: Here we define the tubes connecting the buildings. These

//		 tubes are built along two edges of the rectangle defined by
//		 the given coordinates. Which two sides of the rectangle are
//		 chosen is based on the order of the endpoints. (They are draw
//		 along the y1 and then the x2 coordinates). If it draws along
//		 the wrong sides of the rectangle, interchange the first (x,y)
//		 value pair with the second (x,y) value pair.
// Note: Below we are only defining tubes and no walls, but the
//		 process is exactly the same.

// Note: You can also specify Guard Posts in the vehicle list
//		 since the weapon could not be specified in the 
//		 building list. If you feel this is a cheap hack then
//		 you can also create the Guard Posts directly using
//		 a call to CreateUnit. (Yes, I admit this is a bit of
//		 a hack, but I don't want to add a field to the 
//		 BuildingInfo structure which can only be used by one
//		 building type and needs a dummy value filled in for
//		 all the other building types. Especially not when

// Note: Here we collect (any) five componets of base layout

//		 isn't hidden from the programmer (since that info isn't
//		 associated with the array data itself). This array of
//		 structures has 10 fields which consist of 5 pairs of 
//		 (arraySize, arrayPointer). The macro autosize will take
//		 an array and output an (arraySize, arrayPointer) pair.
//		 If you don't use this macro, you must specify all fields
//		 yourself.
// Note: Since there are no walls, we are using a size of zero
//		 for the array and a null pointer to it (a null pointer
//		 is a value of 0). This is where the double zeros come 
//		 from below. The autosize macro can't be used to specify
//		 both these values since the autosize macro can't make
//		 use of a null array pointer. (Although, ideally it should
//		 output two zeros for you if passed a null pointer but
//		 I can't get this to work. If you know how, let me know.)

//		 place, depending on the order in which the join the game.

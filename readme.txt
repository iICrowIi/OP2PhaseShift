Phase Shift v0.5.0

Phase Shift is a modification of Outpost 2 that alters the game flow in a number of ways.  Check Phase Shift Changes.txt for details.
It relies on OP2ext, which is included in the community build of the game, available at https://www.outpost2.net

The ZIP file is designed to be extracted directly into the installation folder for Outpost 2.  Then, run Outpost2.exe /loadmod PhaseShift to tell the game to use these modified game files.

An example Space Race map, Ohana, is also provided.  It depends on the Outpost Universe's SDK.

Disclaimer
----------
I provide no guarantees of any sort for this mod.
Outpost 2 is an old game, written before many modern coding safety nets existed, and this mod makes the game behave differently than the developers intended; crashes are not out of the question.  Use these scripts at your own risk.

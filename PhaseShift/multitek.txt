BEGIN_TECH "Cybernetic Teleoperation" 03401
    CATEGORY        4
    DESCRIPTION     "Structure Factories may now produce Robot Command Center and Vehicle Factory structure kits.  _______________________________________ Our research has resulted in a specialized variant of the Command Center, with dedicated computers and communications capabilities.  In addition, all vehicle designs now include the less expensive Noesis computer, utilizing elements of the Savant technology.  This transfers much of the computing burden from the Robot Command Center to the vehicle itself."
    TEASER          "Allows production of Robot Command Center and Vehicle Factory structure kits at the Structure Factory.  _______________________________________ Prior to the evacuation from our original colony site, Workers remotely operated our vehicles using a technology called Teleoperation.  Since the catastrophe, we no longer have enough Workers to Teleoperate our vehicles.  The Savant computers at the Command Center have taken on part of this burden, but the job is taxing their capacity.  We need a specialized computer vehicle control system.  This Cybernetic Teleoperation project should allows us to operate a much larger number of vehicles."
